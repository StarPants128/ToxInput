-- ToxInput 0.6 (beta) by StarPants --

This program makes it possible to play SM64DS with "360 degree" joystick controls.
Only compatible with European ROMs and the latest 64 bit X432R version of DeSmuME (0.9.12).
It works with hacked ROMs too, unless they have changed code in certain places.

How to use:

1. Make sure an Xbox controller is connected
2. Start ToxInput
3. Select the right emulator window. If you can't it means that the game or the emulator isn't compatible.
4. Click "Apply". This needs to be done while in title screen when using JIT.

Use at your own risk.
